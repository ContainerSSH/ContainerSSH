title: About the API
---

ContainerSSH itself does not have an API apart from exposing the [metrics](../metrics.md). However, it requires two external API's: the [authentication server](../authserver.md) for user authentication and the [config server](../configserver.md) for supplying a user-specific container configuration.

We are providing an OpenAPI document for both.
