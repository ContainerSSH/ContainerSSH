# An SSH server that launches containers
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fjanoszen%2Fcontainerssh.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fjanoszen%2Fcontainerssh?ref=badge_shield)


This is a Proof of Concept SSH server written in Go that sends any shell directly into a Docker container instead
of launching it on a local machine. It uses an HTTP microservice as an authentication endpoint for SSH connections.

## What is this?

This is an **SSH server that launches containers for every incoming connection**. You can run it on the host or in a
container. It needs two things: an authentication server and access to your container environment (e.g. Docker).

## Quick start

This is a quick start guide to get a test server up and running in less than 5 minutes with
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

To run it grab all files from the [example](example/) directory and run `docker-compose build` followed by 
`docker-compose up` in that directory. This will run the SSH server on your local machine on port 2222. You can log in
with any password using the user "foo" to get an Ubuntu image and "busybox" to get a Busybox image. 

## How does it work?

```

|      |        |              | -----> |  Auth server  |
|      |        |              |        +---------------+
|      |        |              |   
|      |   1.   |              |   3.   +---------------+
| User | -----> | containerssh | -----> | Config server |
|      |        |              |        +---------------+
|      |        |              |   
|      |        |              |   4.   +---------------+
|      |        |              | -----> |    Backend    |
+------+        +--------------+        +---------------+
```

1. The user opens an SSH connection to containerssh.
2. Containerssh calls the authentication server with the users username and password/pubkey to check if its valid.
3. Containerssh calls the config server to obtain backend location and configuration (if configured)
4. Containerssh calls the backend (currently only Docker is supported) to launch the container with the specified
   configuration. All input from the user is sent directly to the backend, output from the container is sent to the
   user.

## Installing

You can run containerssh directly in containers by using the
[janoszen/containerssh](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/janoszen/containerssh) image name. Check the
[docker-compose.yaml example](example/docker-compose.yaml) for details how to set it up.

### Can I install it without containers?

Yes, but for now you will have to build it yourself. Once it hits the first stable release binary releases will be
provided.

## Building

The project can be built using `make build` or `make build-docker`. Alternatively, you can make use of the
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

## Configuring

Before you can run containerssh you will need to create a configuration file. The minimal configuration file looks like
this:

```yaml
ssh:
  hostkeys:
    # Generate a host key with ssh-keygen -t rsa
    - /path/to/your/host/key
auth:
  # See auth server below
  url: http://your-auth-server/
  password: true # Perform password authentication
  pubkey: false # Perform public key authentication
```

Note that the config file must end in `.yml`, `.yaml`, or `.json`. You can dump the entire configuration file using
`./containerssh --dump-config`

## Running

You can run the containerssh server using the following command line:

```
./containerssh --config your/config-file.yaml
```

## Implementing an authentication server

Containerssh does not know your users and their passwords. Therefore, it calls out to a microservice that you have to
provide so it can verify the users, passwords and SSH keys. You will have to provide the microservice URL in the
configuration.

For password authentication containerssh will call out to `http://your-auth-server/password` with the following request
body. The password is base64 encoded to transfer special characters properly.

```json
{
    "user": "username",
    "remoteAddress": "127.0.0.1:1234",
    "sessionId": "A base64 SSH session ID",
    "passwordBase64": "Base 64 password"
}
```

The public key auth containerssh will call out to `http://your-auth-server/pubkey` in the following format.

```json
{
    "user": "username",
    "remoteAddress": "127.0.0.1:1234",
    "sessionId": "A base64 SSH session ID",
    "publicKeyBase64": "Base 64 public key in SSH wire format"
}
```

The public key is provided in the SSH wire format in base64 encoding.

Both endpoints need to respond with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

> **Tip** You can find the source code for a test authentication and configuration server written in Go
> [in this repository](cmd/testAuthConfigServer/main.go)

## Backend selection

Containerssh is built to support multiple backends. At this time only `dockerrun` is implemented, which is described
below. The backend can be changed in the configuration file:

```yaml
backend: dockerrun
```

## Configuration server

You have the option to dynamically change the configuration based on the username by providing a config server URL:

```yaml
configserver:
  url: http://your-config-server-url/
```

The config server will receive a request in following format:

```json
{
  "username":"ssh username",
  "sessionId": "ssh session ID"
}
```

Your application will have to respond in the following format:

```json
{
  "config": {
    // Provide a partial configuration here 
  }
}
```

You can view the full configuration structure in YAML format by running `./containerssh --dump-config`. Note that your
config server must respond in JSON format.

Some configuration values cannot be overridden from the config server. These are the ones that get used before the
connection is established, but the Docker provider also overrides a few, such as `attachstdio`.

## The `dockerrun` backend

The `dockerrun` backend launches a container using the Docker API

### Providing certificates

Docker sockets allow connections over TCP with TLS encryption. You can provide these TLS certificates embedded in the
YAML file in PEM format:

```yaml
dockerrun:
  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:2376
  cacert: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  cert: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  key: |
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### Changing the container image

The container image depends on the backend you are using. For `dockerrun` you can change the image in the config
file:

```yaml
dockerrun:
  config:
    container:
      image: your/image
``` 

### Detailed configuration

The full configuration at the time of writing are as described below. Keep in mind that the configuration structure
may change over time as they follow the
[Docker API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.40/#operation/ContainerCreate).

```yaml
dockerrun:
    host: tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
